<h2>What We've Done So Far</h2>

<p>Previously, as Lock-et, we attempted to help solve problems with
bike theft by developing a smart bike lock. However, after analysis of
our interviews on the product, we concluded that smart bike locks did not
adequetely address the issue of bike theft. We attempted to pivot to a
similar topic in public bike locks, but subsequent interviews led us to
the conclusion that this value prop still did not adequetely solve bike theft
issues. For more information, check our Lock-et interviews here.</p>
