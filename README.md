<h2>What We've Done So Far</h2>

<p>Previously, as Lock-et, we attempted to help solve problems with
bike theft by developing a smart bike lock. However, after analysis of
our interviews on the product, we concluded that smart bike locks did not
adequetely address the issue of bike theft. We attempted to pivot to a
similar topic in public bike locks, but subsequent interviews led us to
the conclusion that this value prop still did not adequetely solve bike theft
issues. For more information, check our Lock-et interviews here.</p>

<h2>Pivoting to Solar Panels</h2>

<p>After much time discussing how we should pivot,
Joey picked up a popular science magazine and read an article on solar energy
and its inefficient nature. From this article, we decided that working on solar
efficiency was a viable project.</p>

<h2>Return of the Product/Market Fit</h2>

<p>As mentioned before in our Lock-et project, we heavily utilized a 
model called Product/Market Fit. We attempt through this model to identify 
our customer segment's jobs, pains, and gains, then match them with a product 
that corrosponds to them.</p>
