<h2>What We've Done So Far</h2>

<p>Previously, as Lock-et, we attempted to help solve problems with
bike theft by developing a smart bike lock. However, after analysis of
our interviews on the product, we concluded that smart bike locks did not
adequetely address the issue of bike theft. We attempted to pivot to a
similar topic in public bike locks, but subsequent interviews led us to
the conclusion that this value prop still did not adequetely solve bike theft
issues.</p>

<p>For more information, check our Lock-et interviews here.</p>

<h2>Pivoting to Solar Panels</h2>

<p>After much time discussing how we should pivot,
Joey picked up a popular science magazine and read an article on solar energy
and its inefficient nature. From this article, we decided that working on solar
efficiency was a viable project.</p>
<br>

<h2>Return of the Product/Market Fit</h2>

<br>

<p>As mentioned before in our Lock-et project, we heavily utilized a 
model called Product/Market Fit. We attempt through this model to identify 
our customer segment's jobs, pains, and gains, then match them with a product 
that corrosponds to them.</p>

<p>For more information on the Product/Market Fit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSDvwQiPtgc" target="_blank">here's</a> a short video.</p>

<h2>Verifying the Customer Segment: Conducting Interviews</h2>

<p>To verify that we've correctly identified the pains and gains of our current 
customer segment (homeowners who are considering to buy solar panels),
we went out on the streets and conducted interviews with 
various individuals that fit towards our demographic. These interviews will 
seek to identify what are the subjects' pains and gains and whether or not 
our value proposition would address them.</p>

<p>For more information on our interviews, consult our interviews folder.</p>
<br>

<h2>Current Value Proposition</h2>

<p>Our value prop is a motorized lever system that tilts the solar panel up and down.
Three sensors located on the panels check how much sunlight the panel is exposed to. The
data gathered from the sensors are used to adjust the solar panel for the maximum
possible exposure to the sun.</p>

<p>Diagrams of our value prop can be found here.</p>
<br>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>As we develop this value prop, it is important to continue interviewing the customer
segment in order to make sure that our value prop satisfied the customers' needs.
Our current interviews showed positive feedback, so we proceeded to come up with a parts
list and an estimated cost, which after markup totaled about $3525 dollars. From here,
we would like to develop an actual prototype and hopefully figure out how to lower the
cost, as well as deal with issues customers brought up when we did our last round of
interviews, like cost and safety concerns.</p>
