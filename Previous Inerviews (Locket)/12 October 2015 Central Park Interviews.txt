3) Peter
	2) Owns 2 standard (hybrid) bikes, used for exercise and leisure - specified NOT for commuting. Uses Citi Bike to commute.
	3) Hasn't had a bike stolen for a long time.
	4) Uses a chain lock, and occassionally a cable for some cases (chains are often very heavy)
	5) The safest way to lock up a bike is using a chain lock. Talks about other methods that he would consider a safe way to lock up
		a bike. Talks about electronic combination locks (like unlocking a Citi Bike), fingerprint electronic locks, and other types of
		body image sensor locks.
	6,7) Completely comfortable leaving the bike close in sight. Prefers to lock up bike where there are lots of other bikes. Also, looks for
		places where people are busy doing other things. With these conditions, comfortable leaving bike for 1-2 hours. Otherwise, only
		comfortable leaving the bike for a very brief period. Values his bikes very highly because they are great for exercise.
	8,9) Notes that biking is only going to increase in New York City. As biking becomes more and more prevalent, people should invent a new
		type of security system for bikes. Security systems for bikes in Europe are taking off, especially public locks. However, borrowing
		is still very limited - you can only ride the bike for a limited duration and only from very specific places to others. Says that
		there is a market for a very good bike security system in cities or for something to play an auxiliary role alongside Citi Bikes
		that would let you take them anywhere, although there may be a pricing concern. Notes that places such as Copenhagen, where biking
		is a huge part of daily life, use crummy bikes to resolve the bike theft problems.
		
4) Kevin G.
	2) Owns 2 bikes, used mainly for exercise, sometimes commuting.
	3) No bikes stolen since he was a child.
	4) Uses a Kryptonite chain lock and an "ice-cream lock". (Note: Ice-cream locks is a term used to describe cable locks, since they are
		good for getting ice-cream and not for longer durations.)
	5) The safest way to lock up a bike is to use a chain through the rear wheel, frame, and a grounded object. Also, have something else,
		such as a cable, go through both the frame and front wheel.
	6) Comfortable leaving bike for .5 - 1 hour.
	7) Not specified.
	8,9) Notes that many people don't follow the bike safety law requiring lights for others to be able to see you. When he is going at speeds
		of 15-18 mph, he would like to see people and avoid a painful collision. Says that Citi Bike took off unexpectedly well. Also, he
		believes that bike lanes will expand in the future at the expense of car lanes (doesn't take a position as to which is better). He
		wishes that businesses would provide places to lock bikes indoors so that the theft problem is greatly reduced.
		
5) David
	2) Owns 2 bikes, one mountain bike and one very "decked out" track bike (this bike had many golden parts). Used for exercise and leisure.
	3) Never had a bike stolen, but knows a large number of friends who have had bikes stolen.
	4,5,6,7) Doesn't use a bike lock and is very insistent that he takes his bike with him into any establishment. He says that "if I can't
			take my bike in with me, I'd rather not go into the building." He wishes to not leave his bike out of sight.
	8,9) Is a part of a cycling aficionado group called Uptown Riders and sported a group jacket on his ride. Wishes that bike theives would
		just stop. Advises to take your stuff on your bike with you, especially the saddle if it isn't locked and is expensive. Is very
		confident that biking is a growing trend in NYC.
