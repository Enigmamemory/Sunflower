EID Interview
Joseph Bentivegna
Name: Jared
Type of bike: Trek
Biking frequency: Every day to and from work.
Where does he lock it: Locks bike against the same stop sign every day, has never had a problem.  At his house he keeps it indoors or at least on his buildings property.
How long is it on the street for: about 7 hours.
Type of lock: U-lock (forgot brand) in conjunction with a wire lock around the back tire.
Cost: together about 45 dollars
Do you feel protected:  Realizes that no matter how good bikes locks say they are they can always be cut and stolen.  Still feels generally protected because he locks it in a decent area. 
Opinions on new technology (i.e. keyless entry, geotagging, crash alert, motion alert): didn’t know that these options were on the market but says he wouldn’t buy it (especially after I told him the price). Says it is interesting but unnecessary and wouldn’t actually offer any more protection. 
He then noted:  “The main priority for me and a lot of other bikers is simply security.  I want my bike to be there when I get back 100% of the time, but unfortunately that can’t be guaranteed at the moment.”
