Solar Interviews

Interview 1:
Name: Justin and Marie 
Got solar panels installed in 2012
Expected payoff in 2025
Cover the entire roof of their house
They face the south because we’re in the northern hemisphere 
Fixed position, metal frame
Installation was easy, came as a huge kit and the company just put it together
They said they would like anything that could decrease the payoff time
They would have been willing to put more money down if they could pay it off in less years
They think it is a good idea and usually support anything green

Interview 2:
Name: Moran family
Installed solar panels in 2014
Expected payoff 2023
More efficient than last family, can work in the shade
Cover part of their roof, but appears to be same surface area as above
Same fixed position but they didn’t know how it was installed
They seemed interested in the product but think that it would be unfortunate that they wouldn’t be able to use it because they already have solar panels installed
Wish it could be added on as an attachment
But still say they would have bought it if it existed




Interview 3:
These were my neighbors who I knew were thinking about getting solar panels and have been doing research to determine if it is worth it
Their main concerns are efficiency and return on investment
They said that with our product it would definitely be more enticing
If it can get the years until return on investment down then they think it’s an amazing idea

Interview 4:
Name: Linda 
Solar panels installed 2013
Doesn’t know expected payoff time (said her husband does)
She said they bought the house with the panels
They were a good selling point
She actually always thought it would be a good idea if they pivoted because the sun isn’t always at the same angle
Thinks our idea would be really good if we can make it cheap and not too big

Notes:
People themselves don’t know that much about the workings of the solar panels and their orientation towards the sun
Main concerns: Time until return on investment and efficiency
If we are going to market this product we would have to sell it to companies that install solar panels so that they can make it an option for people to buy
Need to get in contact with solar companies
