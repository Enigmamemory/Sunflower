Interviews on December 12, 2015; Huntington, NY
Target: Middle-class homeowners who are interested in solar panels.

**Questions**
	1) What is your name?
	2) How long have you been interested in getting solar panels?
	3) Is the cost a big reason why you have yet to get solar panels?
	4) A team of engineers and I are almost finished developing a system that will angle solar panels at the sun. With the increased
		amount of energy absorbed, we estimate that the time required for the solar panels to pay for themselves is up to two
		years less. Would this give you a bigger incentive to buy solar panels?
	5) Can you give me some feedback on what you would like to see improved in our design?

**Responses**
1) "The Clarks" Family
	2) The Clarks have been interested in getting solar panels since the beginning of this summer.
	3) Initial cost seems to be a big hinderance, but they are not as worried about the long-term investment.
	4) They were more inclined to buy solar panels with our technology, but were still worried about the initial cost to buy them.
	5) They didn't give any improvements that they wanted, but mainly wanted to see some of the financing calculations.

2) Quinten Hall
	2) He has been interested in getting solar panels for several years, but never got around to doing it.
	3) Cost was not a huge worry for Quinten. He was mainly doing it to be environmentally conscious. He says he has been hesitent to
		get solar panels since the technology is always getting better, so he is waiting for it to improve.
	4) He was excited about the news that we made a system that increases the efficiency and decreases pay off period.
	5) Quinten would like to see the technology evolve even more in the future, but did not specifically say in what way.

3) Chose to remain anonymous
	2) He began thinking of getting solar panels about a year ago. He is unsure about what to expect since he isn't very tech savvy.
	3) Cost was somewhat of a concern, but says the pay off was worth it since he can make money off solar panels.
	4) He said that it made him more interested in getting solar panels, especially seeing the decrease in the time necessary to pay
		for itself.
	5) Was wondering if we could improve solar panel technology to continue absorbing energy during the nighttime.
